### Forms

Create a basic form that shows various types of inputs inside of a form (text, passwords, radio, select, etc.,). This is up to you and your imagination on what type of page and inputs to collect.  Ensure that the form has proper validation of fields (required, patterns, etc.,).  Have a button that allows a user generate HTML containing the data the typed in.
